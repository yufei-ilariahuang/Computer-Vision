# Lab 8: Edge Detection

## Introduction
This lab explores various edge detection techniques in image processing. Edge detection is crucial for identifying object boundaries and features in images by detecting significant changes in pixel intensity.

## Importance of Edge Detection
Edge detection is fundamental in computer vision for:
- Object Recognition: Helps identify object boundaries and shapes
- Image Segmentation: Assists in separating different regions in images
- Pattern Recognition: Aids in identifying specific patterns and features
- Feature Detection: Crucial for detecting important image features

## Types of Edge Detection Covered

### Sobel Edge Detection

Sobel operator provides both directional (X and Y) edge information:

#### Horizontal Edges (Sobel X)

- Detects vertical changes in intensity
- Highlights horizontal edges
- Uses horizontal gradient kernel

#### Vertical Edges (Sobel Y)

- Detects horizontal changes in intensity
- Highlights vertical edges
- Uses vertical gradient kernel

### Canny Edge Detection
