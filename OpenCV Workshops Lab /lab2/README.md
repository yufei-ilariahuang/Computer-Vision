## Introduction
This lab focuses on fundamental image processing techniques using OpenCV. We explore image loading, display, color space conversion, and basic image manipulation operations.

## Code Structure
The lab consists of several Python files:
- `lab2.py`: Main script containing the `lab2()` function
- `load_image.py`: Contains function for loading images
- `display_image.py`: Contains functions for displaying images and their properties
- `save_image.py`: Contains function for saving images

## Key Functions

### Image Loading
```python
def load_image(image_path, mode=cv2.IMREAD_COLOR):
    # Function implementation in load_image.py
```

### Image Display
```python
def display_image(img, window_name="Image"):
    # Function implementation in display_image.py
```

### Image Saving
```python
def save_image(img, file_name):
    # Function implementation in save_image.py
```

### Image Manipulation
```python
def darker_opencv(image):
    return cv2.convertScaleAbs(image, alpha=0.5, beta=0)

def grayscale_opencv(image):
    return cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
```

## Main Workflow
The main `lab2()` function performs the following steps:
1. Loads an image in color, grayscale, and unchanged modes
2. Displays properties of each loaded image
3. Displays all loaded images side by side
4. Saves the grayscale image
5. Applies and compares different image processing methods (darker, grayscale, HSV conversion)

## Observations and Explanations

1. **Image Loading**: The `load_image()` function can load images in different modes (color, grayscale, unchanged).

2. **Color Space Conversion**: 
   - Grayscale conversion reduces the image to a single channel.
   - HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space is demonstrated in the `compare_methods()` function.

3. **Image Manipulation**: 
   - The `darker_opencv()` function demonstrates basic intensity adjustment.
   - The `grayscale_opencv()` function shows color to grayscale conversion.

## Additional Explorations

The `compare_methods()` function demonstrates:
1. Making an image darker
2. Converting to grayscale
3. Converting to HSV color space

These methods are applied to the same image and displayed side by side for comparison.

## Conclusion

This lab provides hands-on experience with fundamental image processing techniques using OpenCV. It covers image loading, display, basic manipulations, and color space conversions. The side-by-side comparison of different methods allows for visual understanding of these operations.

Future work could involve more advanced techniques such as image filtering, edge detection, or feature extraction.

This README now accurately reflects the structure and content of your lab2.py file, including the use of separate files for loading, displaying, and saving images. It also mentions the main workflow in the `lab2()` function and the additional explorations in the `compare_methods()` function. Feel free to make any further adjustments to better match your specific lab requirements or to add any additional information you think would be helpful for students.
