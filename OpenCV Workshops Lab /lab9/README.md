# Lab 9: Contour Detection and Analysis

## Introduction
This lab explores contour detection and analysis in image processing. Contours are continuous curves that follow the boundaries of objects in images, making them crucial for shape analysis and object detection.

## Importance of Contour Detection
Contour detection is fundamental in computer vision for:
- Object Detection: Identifying distinct objects in images
- Object Segmentation: Separating objects from backgrounds
- Shape Analysis: Understanding object morphology
- Feature Extraction: Capturing geometric properties

## Types of Contour Operations Covered

### Binary Image Preprocessing
